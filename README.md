# INTRODUCTION
Business performance analysis is the process of quantifying a companyâ€™s performance using metrics. This process generally covers a specific period to determine if the business is on track with its forecast and goals. For the company to grow, it needs to know how it is currently doing so that it can either make improvements or prioritize the concepts that are working.  The company performance analysis will use data and numbers to determine how the company meets its expectations i.e. key performance indicators (KPIs). In this project I will delve into carrying out Kevin Cookie Company Performance analysis. The Kevin Cookie Company is a fictional company that serve as the subject of data analysis. 

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the performance of the Kevin Cookie Company. The specific objectives includes:
* Identifying the profit trend over a given period of time between September 2018 to November 2019
* Assessing which product is selling in large quantity by finding out the sum units sold per product 
* Monitoring the profit distribution in the different countries buying from the company.
* Identifying which product is generating the highest profit to the company.
* Finding the relationship between the country population and the sum of units sold
* Identifying if the higher the sum unit sold translate to higher profit generated
# DATA COLLECTION
* The cookie dataset was provided by the Kevin Cookie Company as a excel file which I uploaded to the power BI by use of Get Data capability.
* I extracted the country population dataset from the web by use of power BI Get Data capabilities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population

  # DATA TRANSFORMATION
Data transformation is the process of converting, cleansing, and structuring data into a usable format that can be analyzed to support decision making processes, and to propel the growth of an organization.
In this project data transformation was achieved through the use of Power BI Power Query which included:
* Setting unit sold column to whole number.
* Removing invalid columns.
* 	Renaming of some column headers.
* 		Merging of the cookie table and country population table.

# DATA VISUALIZATION
Data visualization is a graphical representation of data such as charts, plots, info-graphics, and even animations. 
The Kevin Cookie Company visualization has been carried out on the Power BI Dashboard. Some of the graphical representation used are, bar chart, line chart, doughnut chart, funnel chart, and table representation.

# INSIGHTS
Insights be derived from datasets by identifying patterns and relationships using various data analytics tools and techniques. Insights plays a vital role in company decision making. Here are insights drawn from the analysis I conducted on Kevin Cookie Company. 
*	From the profit trend observation, profit is high in some months and low in others with the month of October 2019 being the highest and September 2018 being the lowest.
*	There is a progressive increase in profit on the month of September, October, and December 2019 as compared to 2018. However, the profit is low on November 2019 as compared the November 2018.
*	Chocolate chip is highest selling product in terms of sum unit sold being above 338K units while Snickerdoodle is lowest being 147K units.
*	Canada is the highest profit generating country with the sum of 606.32k, while Mexico is the lowest with the sum of 494.8K.
*	Chocolate chip is the highest profit generating product with the sum profit above 1.0M while fortune cookie is the lowest with sum profit of 123K
*	United States has the highest population and third highest in sum unit product sold while Canada has the lowest population with the highest sum unit product sold

# DISCUSSION
The outcomes of this analysis have provided insight on the company performance over time with a positive trend observed in the comparison between the year 2018 and 2019. However, in the month of November 2019 there was a drop in profit compared to the previous year. This drop in profit on the month of November 2019 could be resulting from low stocks. 

It could be expected that the higher the sum of units products sold would equate to higher profits. On the contrary, higher sum of units sold does not translate to higher profit as observed in the case of snickerdoodles which has the lowest sum of units sold yet it is forth highest in profit generation. Similarly, it could be expected that the country with the highest population would have the highest sum of units sold and or highest sum of profit which is not the case. United States has the highest population yet it falls at the third level for the sum of units products sold and sum profit generated while Canada has the lowest population yet with the highest sum of units sold and sum of profit generated.

The challenge in this analysis is that the data is fictional and hence it may be hard to identify the cause of low profit in some months.

# CONCLUSION 
It is evident that data contains lot of wealth for any given organization which can be used to generate great insights. Company performance analysis is key for the growth of the company without which companies may end up making misinformed decisions and assumptions that may lead to poor performance. For the company to grow, it needs to know how it is currently doing so that it can either make improvements or prioritize the concepts that are working.

# RECOMMENDATIONS 
*	The company should ensure that their inventories are not out of stocks to avoid such drop in sales and profit generation
*	To maximize on profit, the company may consider finding suppliers who would supply ingredients at a lower price.
*	The company may review their marketing strategies to ensure higher sales in countries involved
*	The company may consider investing on advertising the less known products to achieve higher sales
